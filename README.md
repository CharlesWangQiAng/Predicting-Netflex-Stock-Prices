# Predicting-Netflex-Stock-Prices
# Overview
In this project, I focused on predicting the stock prices of Netflix (Netflex) by leveraging deep learning models, specifically Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU). The analysis began with an in-depth exploration of the volatility features within Netflix stock prices. Utilizing TensorFlow, deep learning time series networks were constructed and trained, involving extensive experimentation with activation and regularization functions on GPU for enhanced performance. The models were systematically compared, and the GRU model emerged with the best Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 16.83, indicating superior predictive accuracy. Finally, the selected model was deployed as a service, allowing for real-time prediction of Netflix stock prices. This project demonstrates the effectiveness of deep learning in forecasting stock market trends, offering valuable insights for financial decision-making.
